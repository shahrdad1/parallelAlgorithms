This is an implementation of systolic array defined 
in 'Parallel Algorithms and Architecture' by F. Thomson Leighton'
Page 6. 
I this implementation each process is implemented as a separate erlang node.
There is a pomper node to pomp numbers to the first node.
Nodes are in synch with microseconds approximation.
